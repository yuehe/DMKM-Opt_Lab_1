# Optimization-of-a-neural-network

What is Neural network?
- Neural network is a type of algorithms that are used to “learn”. It learns from existing data, extracts a general model for this dataset. Then the model based on the Neural
Network can be used in some classifying or forecasting fields.

Problem Description
- In this assignment, we use the neural network to do the pattern recognition. The neural network model is actually
determined by its parameters. In order to compute a set of “good” parameters we formulate an optimization model in this assignment and verify the method is fitness.

Result:
- We find the parameters of the neural network (also named network calibration) by using optimization techniques (in this case,
we use the AMPL package to solve the problem).
